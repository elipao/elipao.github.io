# Portfolio Website 
Hello, welcome to my portfolio website. Feel free to take a look, but keep in mind it is still a work in progress! 

P.S. -Please don't copy any of my art, as it is original work (but I am open to comission at liz.k.pao@gmail.com). 

## Concept 
I wanted to design a website that has a modern UI but still maintained a sense of personality. I took inspiration from Microsoft and Apple's web designs, but also through researching different card styles. 

## Tech Stack 
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Aseprite Art
